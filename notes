Notes on challenges and improvements:

1. The goodreads dataset that I'm working on is outdated (only 6 books from 2019, none frome 2020). 
  Would be nice to get an updated dataset. Can't find "My Heart Belongs in Blue Ridge".
  

2. Challenge: Searching the book info df by title. Example title: "Safely Home" returns 8 rows. 
  Differences accounted by:
  - Different authors
  - Different publications of the same book
  - Different formats (paperback vs audio book)
  
  TODO: Use work_id in origianl dataset to collapse these records. (See code starting on line 42.)
