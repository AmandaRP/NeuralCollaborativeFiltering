Notes on challenges and improvements:

0. I might be able to filter the Christian books better. My last recommendation had non-Christian books in it. 
I think the problem is that even if one user (mistakenly) put it on the "Christian" shelf, then 
it's included in the dataset. However, I'm not sure the data is available to do this.
UPDATE: DONE.

1. The goodreads dataset that I'm working on is outdated (only 6 books from 2019, none frome 2020). 
  Would be nice to get an updated dataset. Can't find "My Heart Belongs in Blue Ridge".
  
2. Couldn't find the following books:
  The 49th Mistic https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36548233-the-49th-mystic
  My Heart Belongs in Blue Ridge

2. Challenge: Searching the book info df by title. Example title: "Safely Home" returns 8 rows. 
  Differences accounted by:
  - Different authors
  - Different publications of the same book
  - Different formats (paperback vs audio book)
  
  DONE: Use work_id in origianl dataset to collapse these records. (See code starting on line 63.)

# 1. All popular books are being recommended (chronicals of narnia, mere Christianity, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think this is because I'm not sampling implicit negatives for my group now.   
  
# Top recommendations (after accounting for popularity bias and AFTER excluding our books from test and validation, but making sure that group is given implicit negatives): 
# 1. All popular books are being recommended (chronicals of narnia, mere Christianity, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe). 
# Not sure why. Maybe my group doesn't have enough data? Maybe need a different populartiy bias sampling dist? Maybe need to sample for each epoch?

# Above experiments are suspect (today's date: 11/22) --------------------------
# Reasons:
# 1. p (popularity bias) was not correctly being passed from sampling function to sampling function.
# 2. At some point I renumbered book id's (to reduce model params). My book club id's didn't get updated.
# 3. Also for this run, I only kept books that where on either "fiction" or "christian-fiction" shelves.

# 11/23 Accounted for popularity bias (and filtered by fiction books):
# hr 0.589 
# ndcg 0.369 
# test accuracy: ?
# Run time: ~14 hours. Patience was set to only 1.
# Top recommendations from 11/23 model:
# LOTS of Francine Rivers books (with some Lynn Austin thrown in)
# model: model_20201123.h5 (also saved a version in /data)

# 11/24 Did NOT Accounted for popularity bias (and filtered by fiction books, sampling impl neg for each epoch):
# hr .376
# ndcg .201
# test accuracy: 0.6325731
# patience was set to only 1.

# 11/24 Did NOT Accounted for popularity bias (and filtered by fiction books, sampling impl neg for each epoch):
# Top recommendations were most popular books: 1. The Lion the Witch & the wardrobe, 2. The Chronicals of Narnia, 3. Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience
# model: model.h5 model_20201124.h5

#12/2: Reran 11/23 model to verify. Only change: Set patience to 2.
# hr (test):   0.592
# ndcg (test):  0.373
# validation accuracy: 0.425
# test accuracy: 0.9552872
# Run time: ~21 hours. (3 epochs)
# Recommendations: Top 10 are all Francine Rivers books
# model: model.h5 model_20201202.h5

#12/3: Reran 11/24 model to verify. Only change: Set patience to 2.
# hr (test):   
# ndcg (test):  
# validation accuracy: 
# test accuracy: 
# Run time: 
# Recommendations: 

# Interesting observation on 11/23 and 12/2 vs 11/24 and 12/3: Validation accuracy was *much* higher for run where I did NOT account for popularity bias. However, test ndcg and hr were much higher for run where I *did* account for popularity bias. Need to compare test accuracy between two runs. Would it be better to use ndcg for stopping criteria?
