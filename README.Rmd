## Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

This is an implementation of NCF using [R Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html). The model is described in the following paper and implemented by its authors using Keras (see [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_collaborative_filtering)).

## To start

Run the code in "run.R"-- it will source the necessary scripts, fit the model, and provide evaluation metrics. 
You can choose between the Movie Lense dataset or a Pinterest dataset. 

## Data

Data is provided by the NCF paper authors on their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_collaborative_filtering/tree/master/Data). They provide two datasets: Movie Lense and Pinterest, which is described in their paper. The "readData.R" scipt will read these datasets.
