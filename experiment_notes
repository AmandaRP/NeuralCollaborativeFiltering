Notes on challenges and improvements:

0. I might be able to filter the Christian books better. My last recommendation had non-Christian books in it. 
I think the problem is that even if one user (mistakenly) put it on the "Christian" shelf, then 
it's included in the dataset. However, I'm not sure the data is available to do this.
UPDATE: DONE.

1. The goodreads dataset that I'm working on is outdated (only 6 books from 2019, none frome 2020). 
  Would be nice to get an updated dataset. 
  
2. Couldn't find the following books:
  The 49th Mistic https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36548233-the-49th-mystic
  My Heart Belongs in Blue Ridge

2. Challenge: Searching the book info df by title. Example title: "Safely Home" returns 8 rows. 
  Differences accounted by:
  - Different authors
  - Different publications of the same book
  - Different formats (paperback vs audio book)
  
  DONE: Use work_id in origianl dataset to collapse these records. (See code starting on line 63.)

> book_info %>% filter(title == "Safely Home") %>% select(book_id, title, link, authors, publication_year)

# Above experiments are suspect (today's date: 11/22) --------------------------
# Reasons:
# 1. p (popularity bias) was not correctly being passed from sampling function to sampling function.
# 2. At some point I renumbered book id's (to reduce model params). My book club id's didn't get updated.
# 3. Also for this run, I only kept books that where on either "fiction" or "christian-fiction" shelves.

# TODO:
1. See TODO under 12/2 model 
2. Try arrow in evaluation method to speed up
3. I think patience needs tweaked. (Need to check that last x *changes in loss* were positive, not that current loss is greater than last x losses.)


# Thoughts: 
1. Was thinking that it be better to use ndcg for stopping criteria. (Can't currently do that since I only have positive cases in validation.) This would NOT be a good idea. Stopping should be done on loss since this is what the function is minimizing.

# Thoughts on why I may not be getting good recommendations:
1. My group's training data may not be large enough. Need a model that is better for cold start (takes side features such as author & book description)
2. No hyperparameter tuning? (My AWS instance is too small... ~7 hours per epoch)
3. Point out criticisms of NCF?


---------------
Fixed evaluation.R to handle ties.

# May 2021 experiment where popularity biased sampling of implicit negatives was NOT used:
HR@10: 0.902
NDGC@10: 0.749
Recommendations:
1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
2. Even Now (Lost Love, #1) by Karen Kingsb__ https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1146065
3. The Hiding Place
4. The Screwtape Letters
5. The Chronicles of Narnia

-----------------------

# Exp 1: May 6 experiment: Rerunning prev experiment to be absolutely sure that I cleared former Keras model
# Details : No popularity bias sampling.
Test HR@10: 0.816
Test NDCG@10: 0.654  
-Amazingly, if I compute the HR & NDCG for books ordered solely based on popularity, then I get the same metrics! (The test set was chosen without down sampling pop items, so the metrics will be higher here than for a test set where pop items were downsampled.)
-This shows that you DO want to down-sample pop items at-least for the test set. In other words, what do you want to measure? Do you want to measure that you can predict popular items well? No!
*** My thougths: Comparing this experimetn to one where pop biased sampling is used is NOT comparing apples to apples unless we use the same test set. 
1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
2. The Chronicles of Narnia
3. Unbroken
4. Mere Christianity
5. The Screwtape Letters
6. The Hidinng Place
7. The Great Divorce (CS Lewis)
8. Uncle Tom's Cabin
9. Edenbrooke https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22665876
10. The Holy Bible, King James Version
Oberservation: This list is very correlated to the list of items sorted by popularity, but it contains books that I would actually read (not the poisonwood bible, which is now ranked #17). Kind of like a "slightly"" personalized popular list.

# Exp 2: May 11, 2021 experiment #2 (rerunning model WITH popularity biased sampling of both train and test to see if HR changed after fixing evaluation.R)
# TODO: Check numbers against my blog post because I've changed evaluation code to handle ties differently. Did they change?

# Exp 3: After saving test set from prev expierment, run an expiriment where the TRAINING set does not use popularity down-sampling.
